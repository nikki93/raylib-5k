# Packet Lost

This is the code and assets repository for our (me, Luka and Axi) Raylib 5K jam submission, ["Packet Lost"](https://itch.io/jam/raylib-5k-gamejam/rate/1374384)!

It uses my Go->C++ transpiler, called [Gx](https://github.com/nikki93/gx), along with my own little framework around Raylib that includes an entity system, a scene editor and seriaization. The jam entry doesn't use the serialization system much since the world is procedurally generated, but the editor came in handy during development to debug and explore the resulting scene.

I'll be adding much more information here soon! Part of the motivation for doing the jam was to have a resulting open source example like this that uses Gx. But the jam was tiring and now I should probably rest for a bit so... Will get to that in a little while... ðŸ˜…
